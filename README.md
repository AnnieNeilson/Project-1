-Accessibility- lighthouse scores
	-When generating a lighthouse report, the performance score fluctuated between 69-89. I tried researching how to increase the score, but found the solutions
were mostly regarding JavaScript, which is not included in my site. I generated another report on a different computer and wifi connection and the score came back 99. I'm still unsure of the cause of the issue.
